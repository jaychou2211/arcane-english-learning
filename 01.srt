00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,666
Well, demand for your wares has dropped
since we made our arrangements.

332

This is the new value.

Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We, um…

we shook on it.

Ten thousand.

00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,041
-Such are the risks of business.
-Ten.

337
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,041
It's a fair price.

338
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,166
I think you should take it.

339
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,416
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

Leave us.

You sure about that?

-Piss off.

I expected something… younger.

357
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,041
We were expecting traders
who would honor their word,

358
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,791
so I guess we're all disappointed.

359

You got us all wrong, my friend.

360

We were just… negotiating.

Now you're speaking my language.

362
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,541
How about you just give Huck
the rest of what you owe him,

363
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,750
and I'll let you walk out of here
in one piece?

I don't suppose you can explain why it is
that I'm hearing about an explosion

That we can handle a real job.

A real job?

386
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,250
We got our own tip, planned a route,
nobody even saw.

-You blew up a building.
-That wasn't…

Did you even stop to think about
what could have happened to you?

we have to earn our place in this world.

-We stay out of Piltover's business.
-Why?

They've got plenty, while we're down here
scraping together coins.

When did you get so comfortable
living in someone else's shadow?

You know, but you don't know.

you don't get to be selfish.

what happens to us down here.

We make ourselves a problem for Piltover,
and they will send the enforcers.

So? Why answer to them?

These are our streets.

[Ekko grunts]

490
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,041
-[Ekko] Claggor.
-[Claggor] He-he-hey, Little Man.

491
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:31,666
You're a little early.

492
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,875
My guys are still roundin' up
this month's collections.

493
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:37,250
Won't have numbers until next, um…

494
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:38,916
[Benzo] Whoo.

495
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,083
Why are you muckin' about with this?

496
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,041
I assume you've heard.

497
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,041
Yeah, me and half the undercity.

498
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,833
[sighs]
How could they be so stupid?

499
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,375
The younger folk think
it's the right thing to do.

500
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,291
[Vander] Yeah, and Vi's one of them.

501
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,250
Throws herself at trouble
wherever she can find some.

502
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,333
Eh, they're growing up, Vander.

503
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,708
Looking to write their own stories.
You can't protect them forever.

504
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:04,833
[sighs]

505
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,500
Someone was following them.

506
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:10,041
-Whole lot of someones, from what I heard.
-Not enforcers.

507
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,750
-Someone on our side.
-Who?

508
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:17,250
There's worse things
than enforcers out there.

509
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,833
We both know that.

510
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,458
Yeah, I was hopin' you'd be working today.

511
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,333
-Did you guys go?
-Sure did.

512
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:28,125
Hey, listen, how did you find that place?

513
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,708
-I just--
-Whoa, did you fight the enforcers?

514
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,583
What? Oh, no. Eh, just some bums.

515
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,625
Oh, did Vi kick their asses?

516
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,666
Yeah, I mean,
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

517
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,708
Oh, she showed me
a couple moves to practice. Look.

518
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,333
[Ekko grunting]

519
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:44,458
-Yeah, it's… it's coming along.
-Ya!

520
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,541
Hey, so, how'd you find
that place, anyway?

521
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,833
Uh, this weirdo came into the shop.

522
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,791
Bought a whole bunch of stuff
Benzo only keeps there for display.

523
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,125
He paid in gold and didn't even haggle.

524
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,000
I charged him double price. Sucker.

525
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,500
-But how did you know where he lived?
-Uh, followed him.

526
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,666
-How else?
-Oh. Right.

527
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,916
[Claggor] Oh, crap.

528
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,291
[breathing]

529
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,125
-Uh…
-They'll be fine. Go.

530
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, hello.

531
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,333

[wind gusts]

534
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,500
-[Benzo] Evening, friends.
-[hissing]

535
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,833
[whispers]
Shit.

536
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,166
[sighs]

537
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,791
Something I can help you with?

538
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:41,500
Some trencher trash attacked one
of the buildings in the Academy district,

539
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,083
but you already knew that.

540
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,125
We're looking for the culprits.

541
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,208
Got a description?

542
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:50,166
Yeah, it's exactly who you're picturing
in that thick head of yours.

543
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,416
Mm. You think my head is thick?

544
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,583
Uh, just past the average.

545
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,958
Listen, you shady son of a…

546
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,791
[enforcer] How about you go
for a little walk, Marcus?

547
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,375
Cool off a bit.

548
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,541
Go.

549
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,083

[Benzo] Lovely chap you've brought.

555
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,916
[indistinct chatter]

556
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:39,583
[enforcer] Don't mind the kid.

557
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,666
Doesn't know when to pipe down.

558
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,250
[Vander] Some things are the same
topside and bottom.

559
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,125
You know this crossed a line upstairs.

560
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,416
Was anyone hurt?

561
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,416
A building was blown to bits.
What do you think?

562
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,416
[sighs]

563
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,541
Those who did this will be dealt with.

564
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,291
That workshop belonged to the Kirammans.

565
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,125
You know what kind of stuff
they had in there?

566
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,250
Makes this place look like a candy shop.

567
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,750
The Council needs someone
to make an example of.

568
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,583
People need to feel safe.

569
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,416
Yeah, topside people.

570
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,291
[enforcer] We had a deal, Vander.

571
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:22,375
You keep your people off my streets,
and I stay out of your business.

572
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,875
Give me a name. We'll do things quiet.

573
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,958
No one will know you were involved.

574
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,500
I can't do that.

575
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,791
You don't seem to grasp
how serious this is.

576
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,250
If I don't put someone
behind bars tonight,

577
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:40,375
the next time I come down here,
I'll have an army of enforcers with me.

578
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,583
We both know how that'll go.

579
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:46,583
I'm sorry, Grayson,
but I can't offer up my own people.

580
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:51,833
[exhales]

581
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,208
If you change your mind,
this will reach me.

582
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,833
[Grayson] And only me.

583
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,833

[rock music playing continues]

589
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,625
What are you calling this one?

590
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,500
[Powder] Whisker.

591
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,666
-You wanna talk about today?
-What's the point?

592
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,958
I ruined everything. I always do.

593
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,333
Nobody said that.

594
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:43,416
No. Just that you were
"twice the person" at half my age.

595
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,083
You heard them.

596
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,083
I'm not a fighter.

597
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,500
You don't have to be.

598
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:54,916
Look, I've got these and you've got those.

599
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,583
They never work.

600
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,416
They will.

601
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,416
-Come with me.
-What?

602
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,208
[Vi] Come on.

603
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,625
[background chatter]

604
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,625
What are we doing here?

605
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,833
See that gutter running along the canal?

606
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:34,041
[Vi] That's where Claggor got his foot
stuck running from enforcers.

607
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:38,125
They thought it was funny,
so they left him there.

608
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,125
He was out all night before we found him.

609
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,541
That sign?

610
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,208
-[Vi] You see it?
-[Powder] Uh-huh.

611
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,666
Mylo tripped over his own paint bucket

612
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,458
and nearly fell off trying to draw
a giant middle finger.

613
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,166
-[Vi] His ass made that splotch.
-[Powder laughs]

614
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,333
And that?

615
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:03,875
[Vi sighs]

616
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:07,875
When I was a kid, some guy took
my favorite toy and threw it up there.

617
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,458
I used to come out here at night
and stare at it,

618
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:17,375
hoping maybe the wind
or a bird might knock it down.

619
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,625
We've all had bad days.

620
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:27,083
But we learn. And we stick together.

621
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,291
Oh, I forgot.

622
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,541
These were in my pocket.

623
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,958
-They're from the apartment.
-What are they?

624
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:40,958
I don't know.

625
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,083
-Should we show Vander?
-No.

626
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,250
[exhales]

627
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,833
Let's keep this our little secret.

628
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:56,000
Mylo's wrong, Powder.
You're stronger than you think.

629
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,333
And one day…

630
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,541
this city's gonna respect us.

631
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:05,166

[grumbles]

637
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,666
[man 1] You were supposed to follow them
and not interfere.

638
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,708
[grunting]
I'm sorry.

639
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,208
[Deckard] They just caught us by surprise.

640
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:48,416
[man 1] Now his accomplice
is asking questions about you.

641
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,208
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

642
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:53,541
[grunts]

643
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:59,833
The kids. It was their fault,
the explosion in the upper city.

644
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,708
[man 1] That was them?

645
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:05,416
[Deckard] Yeah. The topsiders
are up in arms looking for 'em.

646
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,625
[man 1] Vander's in trouble.

647
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,583
[nervous chuckle]

648
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,750
[man 1] Smartest thing you ever said, boy.

649
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,625
